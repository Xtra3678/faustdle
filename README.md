A one piece wordle clone. Heavily based on the concept of One Piecedle, but made to be better in pretty much every way, as far as the main game mode is concerned. Has pretty much every character in one piece, with the really really really obscure ones being locked behind a hard mode. Hard mode is really not recommended to be played, normal characters can still appear but god does one piece have a lot of nobodies with no distinguishable traits so I highly recommend not playing that one.
